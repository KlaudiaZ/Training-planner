# Training planner app
My small personal project through which I aim to create a functional mobile application allowing the user to store various physical exercises and combine them into personalized training plans.

Written using jQuery, SCSS, and HTML5.

Progress: about 75% of the app's features is finished.

- Current features:
  - can create and store a list of user-defined exercises
  - the list can be sorted, exercises can be modified and/or removed by the user

- Features in-progress:
  - creating separate editable lists ("plans", up to 10 different ones) of exercises picked by the user from the "main" list (mentioned above)

- Planned steps:
  - compile and host a complete beta version for preview purpose
  - rewrite the application and create its mobile counterpart using React and React Native.

Creator's note: Please keep in mind that I began writing this application way before I knew about React. Therefore, while I want to finish writing it in jQuery for the sake of practice, the current version will not be converted to mobile. Consider it a functional prototype, sort of, as I'm planning to make the final version much clearer, neater, and hopefully more professional.
